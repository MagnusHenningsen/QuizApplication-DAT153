### Quiz Test
> Initializes the viewModel in the application context to avoid errors down the line as this is normally done in the main activity
> Launches the quiz activity and gets the current "answer"
> Collects rounds played / won from the shared preferences
> Selects the correct option based on the name of the current answer
> Collects rounds played / won from the shared preferences again
> Compares the score before and after and returns the result
>> this should in most cases work unless the name is somehow altered when put on the button.
